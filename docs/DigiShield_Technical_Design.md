## 1. Architecture Overview

DigiShield is a **multi-tenant SaaS** platform built on a **gradually-decoupling, event-driven modular monolith** architecture — the core is a single deployment unit with clearly bounded modules (Auth, Learning, Simulation, Reporting, Analytics, Notification, AI, Tenancy/Billing), progressively split into microservices as scaling/team needs arise (see **ADR-001** in `DigiShield_ADR.md`). Each organization (tenant) has its data logically isolated via `org_id`/`tenant_id`. Heavy tasks (bulk email/SMS sending, AI analysis) run asynchronously through queues using a separate worker pool. Packaged in containers so it can run both in the cloud and on-premise/air-gapped (government sector); managed serverless is not used as the core.

**Key design principles:**
- API-first: every capability is exposed through a versioned REST API (`/api/v1`).
- Domain-Driven service separation: Auth, Learning, Simulation, Reporting, Analytics, Notification, AI.
- Asynchronous for high volumes: Message Queue + Workers.
- Defense in depth: JWT + RBAC + audit log + encryption.
- Flexible deployment: domestic cloud **or** on-premise (government sector).

## 2. System Context Diagram (C4 – Context)

**Description:** The highest-level diagram, showing the context in which DigiShield (the central block) sits — *who uses it* and *which external systems it connects to*. On the left are 4 user groups (Learner, Org Admin/Manager, Analyst SOC, Content Editor) with different usage purposes. On the right are 5 external systems the platform depends on: SSO (authentication), Email/SMS Gateway (sending simulations & notifications), NCSC/chongluadao.vn (blacklist synchronization — bidirectional arrow), and LLM API (AI content generation/classification). Read this diagram to identify the *integration scope* and stakeholders before diving into details.

## 3. Component Diagram (Container/Component)

**Description:** "Opens up" the system into 4 layers. The **Client Layer** includes the Web App, Browser Extension, and Email Add-in (where the "Report phishing" button lives). Every request passes through the **API Gateway** (JWT authentication, rate-limiting, routing) to **7 microservices** separated by business domain. Heavy tasks (bulk email/SMS sending, AI jobs) are pushed to the **Async Layer** (Message Queue + Workers + Scheduler) so they don't block requests. The **Data Layer** comprises PostgreSQL (business data), Redis (cache/queue), and Object Storage (media, reports). Note: only Simulation, Notification, and AI Service emit jobs to the queue.

## 4. Deployment Diagram

**Description:** How the system actually runs on infrastructure. Traffic comes in via the **CDN/WAF** (attack protection, static distribution) → **Load Balancer** (TLS termination) → **Ingress** of the **Kubernetes** cluster, where the pods (API Gateway, services, workers) scale with load. The **Stateful/Managed** tier (PostgreSQL primary+replica, Redis, message broker, object storage) is separated from the pods for data durability. The **Observability** tier collects logs, metrics, and tracing. The same topology can be deployed **on-premise** for government agencies that must keep data in-country.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Edge
        CDN[CDN / WAF]
        LB[Load Balancer<br/>TLS termination]
    end

    subgraph K8s[Kubernetes Cluster]

        subgraph Pods
            P1[API Gateway pods]
            P2[Service pods x N]
            P3[Worker pods x N]
        end
    end

    subgraph Stateful[Stateful / Managed]
        DB[(PostgreSQL<br/>Primary + Replica)]
        REDIS[(Redis cluster)]
        BUS[(Message Broker)]
        BLOB[(Object Storage)]
    end

    subgraph Obs[Observability]
        LOG[Log aggregation]
        MON[Metrics/Tracing]
    end

    CDN --> LB --> ING --> P1 --> P2
    P2 --> DB & REDIS & BUS & BLOB
    P3 --> BUS & DB
    P2 & P3 --> LOG & MON
```

> **On-premise:** same topology but deployed within the government agency's internal infrastructure, with data stored in-country, independent of external cloud.

## 5. Data Model (ER Diagram)

**Description:** Entity-relationship diagram of the core tables. At the center is `ORGANIZATIONS` (tenant) — nearly every business table has an `org_id` to isolate data between organizations. The main clusters: *user management* (organizations, users, departments, groups), *learning* (courses → lessons → quizzes, enrollments), *simulation* (sim_templates → sim_campaigns → sim_events), *reporting & alerting* (reports, alerts, blacklist_entries), and *measurement/audit* (risk_scores, audit_logs). Notation: `||--o{` = one-to-many, `}o--o{` = many-to-many (e.g., users ↔ groups). Each block lists representative fields along with primary key (PK)/foreign key (FK).

## 6. Sequence Diagrams (Business Flows)

### 6.1. SSO Login (SAML/OAuth)

**Description:** Single sign-on (SSO) login flow for enterprise/government. The user is redirected by the Auth Service to the identity provider (IdP) for authentication; when the IdP returns a valid assertion, the system **automatically creates/syncs the account and assigns the role**, then issues a JWT pair (access + refresh). Points to note when coding: mapping IdP attributes → role and handling first-time login users (just-in-time provisioning).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant W as Web App
    participant GW as API Gateway
    participant AUTH as Auth Service
    participant IDP as SSO IdP

    U->>W: Access DigiShield
    W->>GW: GET /auth/sso/login?org=...
    GW->>AUTH: Initiate SSO
    AUTH-->>W: Redirect to IdP
    W->>IDP: Log in (SAML/OAuth)
    IDP-->>W: Callback + token/assertion
    W->>GW: POST /auth/sso/callback
    GW->>AUTH: Validate assertion
    AUTH->>AUTH: Create/sync user, assign role
    AUTH-->>W: JWT (access + refresh)
    W-->>U: Enter dashboard by role
```

### 6.2. Phishing Simulation Campaign + Click Tracking + Just-in-time Coaching

**Description:** The core flow of the Simulate module. The Manager creates a campaign → the Simulation Service pushes the email-sending job through the queue (asynchronous to handle high load). Each email embeds a **tracked link/pixel**: when a Learner *opens* or *clicks*, the tracking endpoint records a `sim_event`. The moment a click occurs, the system does two things in parallel: displays the **Just-in-time coaching page** (teaching right at the point of the mistake) and **updates the risk_score**. When coding, ensure tracking is idempotent and does not "punish" the user — the goal is to teach, not to catch mistakes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor M as Manager
    participant GW as API Gateway
    participant SIM as Simulation Service
    participant MQ as Message Queue
    participant WK as Worker (Email)
    participant EG as Email Gateway
    actor L as Learner
    participant TRK as Tracking Endpoint
    participant LRN as Learning Service

    M->>GW: POST /sim/campaigns (template, target, schedule)
    GW->>SIM: Create campaign (status=scheduled)
    SIM->>MQ: enqueue email sending by target
    MQ->>WK: email sending job
    WK->>EG: Send simulation email (link with tracking)
    EG-->>L: Email arrives in inbox

    L->>TRK: Open email -> pixel (action=open)
    TRK->>SIM: POST /sim/events {open}
    L->>TRK: Click link (action=click)
    TRK->>SIM: POST /sim/events {click}
    SIM->>LRN: Trigger lesson auto-enroll
    TRK-->>L: Just-in-time coaching page<br/>(explains the missed signals)
    SIM->>SIM: Update user's risk_score
```

### 6.3. User Reports Phishing Email → AI Classifies → Blacklist Check → Alert Broadcast

**Description:** The "Report & Alert" flow. The Learner clicks the report button from the extension/add-in → the Reporting Service stores the report → the **AI Service classifies** it (clean/spam/threat + confidence) → checks against the **blacklist**. The `alt` block represents the decision branch: if confidence *exceeds the auto threshold*, the email is mass-quarantined immediately; if uncertain, it goes into the **triage queue** for an Analyst to decide. When confirmed as a real threat, the Notification Service **broadcasts a realtime alert** to the whole organization over WebSocket. This is the "collective intelligence" loop: one person reports, the whole organization is protected.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor L as Learner
    participant BX as Browser Ext / Add-in
    participant GW as API Gateway
    participant REP as Reporting Service
    participant AIS as AI Service
    participant BL as Blacklist Store
    actor AN as Analyst SOC
    participant NOT as Notification Service
    participant WS as WebSocket Hub

    L->>BX: Click "Report phishing"
    BX->>GW: POST /reports/phishing (payload)
    GW->>REP: Store report (status=new)
    REP->>AIS: Request classification
    AIS-->>REP: {label, confidence, reason}
    REP->>BL: Check URL/phone/account
    BL-->>REP: matched? (true/false)
    alt confidence >= auto threshold
        REP->>NOT: Mass-quarantine email + alert
    else needs review
        REP-->>AN: Show in triage queue
        AN->>GW: POST /reports/{id}/triage (decision)
        GW->>REP: Update status + update blacklist
    end
    REP->>NOT: Broadcast alert if threat
    NOT->>WS: Broadcast to whole organization
    WS-->>L: Realtime alert notification
```

### 6.4. Adaptive Learning Framework – Risk-based Auto-enrollment

**Description:** The self-running "adaptive learning" mechanism. On schedule (Scheduler), the Analytics Service **recomputes the risk_score** from sim_events, quiz results, and reporting behavior, then hands it off to **AI Orchestration (AIDA)** to choose the appropriate course/level and **auto-enroll** the user. When the learner completes it, the progress flows back to Analytics to recompute risk — creating a continuous improvement loop. High-risk users are assigned more; strong users get a reduced load.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SCH as Scheduler
    participant ANA as Analytics Service
    participant AIDA as AI Orchestration
    participant LRN as Learning Service
    actor L as Learner

    SCH->>ANA: Periodically recompute risk_score
    ANA->>ANA: Aggregate sim_events, quiz, report
    ANA-->>AIDA: risk_score + weaknesses by domain
    AIDA->>AIDA: Choose appropriate course/level
    AIDA->>LRN: Auto-enroll (adaptive)
    LRN-->>L: Assign new lesson + deadline reminder
    L->>LRN: Complete lesson + quiz
    LRN->>ANA: Update progress -> recompute risk
```

### 6.5. AI Generates Simulated Phishing Templates (with Moderation)

**Description:** How AI helps the Content Editor create templates quickly but safely. The Editor states a request (industry, season, channel) → the AI Service calls the LLM with a prompt *constrained to Vietnamese scenarios* → the draft must pass a **Moderation step** before final human approval. Only templates in the `approved` state can be used for campaigns. The Moderation step is a key control point to prevent AI-generated content from being misused or inappropriate.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor E as Content Editor
    participant GW as API Gateway
    participant AIS as AI Service
    participant LLM as LLM API
    participant MOD as Moderation
    participant DB as DB (sim_templates)

    E->>GW: POST /ai/templates/generate (industry, season, channel)
    GW->>AIS: Request content generation
    AIS->>LLM: Prompt constrained to VN scenarios
    LLM-->>AIS: Email/SMS draft
    AIS->>MOD: Moderate content safety
    MOD-->>AIS: pass/flag
    AIS-->>E: Draft for approval
    E->>GW: PATCH approve
    GW->>DB: Store template (status=approved)
```

## 7. State Diagrams (Entity Lifecycles)

### 7.1. Phishing Report Lifecycle

**Description:** The states a report passes through, used to design the `status` field of the `reports` table and the transition logic. From `New` → AI classification; then it branches: high confidence goes to `AutoQuarantined`, the rest go to `InReview` for the Analyst to decide `Confirmed` (threat) or `Dismissed` (clean/spam). A confirmed threat goes to `Broadcasted` (alert broadcast) and then `Closed`. This diagram is the source of truth for validity checks on state transitions.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> New: User submits
    New --> AIClassified: AI classifies
    AIClassified --> AutoQuarantined: high confidence (threat)
    AIClassified --> InReview: needs review
    InReview --> Confirmed: Analyst confirms threat
    InReview --> Dismissed: Clean/Spam
    Confirmed --> Broadcasted: Broadcast alert
    AutoQuarantined --> Broadcasted
    Broadcasted --> Closed
    Dismissed --> Closed
    Closed --> [*]
```

### 7.2. Simulation Campaign Lifecycle

**Description:** The states of a Simulate campaign, mapping directly to `sim_campaigns.status`. `Draft` → `Scheduled` (scheduled) → `Running` (sending) → `Collecting` (collecting events) → `Completed` → `Reported` (generate report + auto-enroll lessons for those who fell for the trap). It can be `Cancelled` from Draft/Scheduled. The diagram helps determine when editing/cancelling is allowed and when to open/close the event collection window.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Scheduled: Schedule
    Scheduled --> Running: Time to send
    Running --> Collecting: Collecting events
    Collecting --> Completed: Time elapsed
    Completed --> Reported: Generate report + auto-enroll
    Reported --> [*]
    Draft --> Cancelled
    Scheduled --> Cancelled
```

## 8. Flowchart – Risk Score Calculation

**Description:** The algorithm for calculating a user's risk score — the input for adaptive learning and smart grouping. The system takes 90 days of data (sim_events, quizzes/enrollments, reporting behavior), applies **weights**: adds points for simulation clicks/submits or for overdue lessons; subtracts points for correct reports or completed lessons. It aggregates & normalizes to a 0–100 scale, then thresholds: `≥70` high risk (reinforced auto-enroll), `40–69` monitor, `<40` maintain. The result is stored in `risk_scores`. This is the business specification for implementing the scoring function (weights/thresholds should be made configurable).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Start risk_score calculation]) --> C1[Fetch 90-day sim_events]
    C1 --> C2[Fetch quiz/enrollment results]
    C2 --> C3[Fetch phishing reporting behavior]
    C3 --> W{Compute weights}
    W --> R1[+ points: simulation click/submit]
    W --> R2[- points: correct report, completed lesson]
    W --> R3[+ points: overdue lesson]
    R1 & R2 & R3 --> AGG[Aggregate & normalize 0-100]
    AGG --> SEG{risk_score}
    SEG -->|>= 70| HIGH[High-risk group<br/>reinforced auto-enroll]
    SEG -->|40-69| MED[Monitor]
    SEG -->|< 40| LOW[Maintain]
    HIGH & MED & LOW --> Save[(Store risk_scores)]

## 10. Event Model (Event/Queue)

The main events flow through the Message Broker (suggested topics):

| Topic | Producer | Consumer | Main Payload |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------|

## 11. Security & Non-functional Requirements

- **Authentication/Authorization:** short-lived JWT + refresh; RBAC with 6 roles (Super Admin, Org Admin, Manager, Content Editor, Analyst, Learner); scoped by tenant + department.
- **Encryption:** TLS 1.2+ in transit; at-rest encryption for sensitive data; secrets managed via a secrets manager.
- **Privacy:** do not publicly disclose the identity of individuals who "fell for the trap"; anonymous culture surveys; compliance with the Personal Data Protection Decree.
- **Audit:** every sensitive action is logged to `audit_logs` (actor, action, target, ip, ts).
- **Performance:** campaigns to tens of thousands of people sent via queue; dashboard < 2s; Redis cache for analytics.
- **Availability:** target uptime ≥ 99.5%; periodic backups; DR plan.
- **Data sovereignty:** option for in-country / on-premise storage for the government sector.
- **Observability:** centralized logging, metrics, distributed tracing.

## 12. 100% Specification Closure Supplement

This section supplements the missing/partial features to fully match the product specification: **gamification, knowledge & culture assessments, ThreatFlip, certificates, bulk import/SCIM, reminders, AI moderation, AI orchestration, coaching content, compliance policy**.

### 12.1. Supplementary Data Entities (Extended ER)

**Description:** The extended ER for advanced features, continuing the model in Section 5. It adds the clusters: *gamification* (badges, user_badges, points_ledger), *assessment* (assessments, assessment_responses — `user_id` nullable to support anonymous surveys), *certificates* (certificates), *notifications/reminders* (notifications), *ThreatFlip* (threat_intel that can be converted into a sim_template), *coaching* (coaching_pages attached to a template), and *compliance* (compliance_policies). These tables all have an `org_id` and integrate with the existing core tables.

### 12.3. Sequence — Gamification (Awarding Points & Badges)

**Description:** An event-driven reward mechanism. When a reward-worthy event occurs (e.g., a correct report, a completed lesson) and is published to the queue, the **Gamification Service** applies the point rules, writes to the `points_ledger`, then checks the badge criteria. If met, it grants a `user_badge` and sends a notification + updates the leaderboard. The event-driven design decouples gamification from the core business and makes it easy to add new rules.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SRC as Event source<br/>(correct report / completed lesson)
    participant MQ as Message Queue
    participant GAM as Gamification Service
    participant DB as DB (points/badges)
    participant NOT as Notification
    actor L as Learner

    SRC->>MQ: emit event (e.g.: report.confirmed)
    MQ->>GAM: process point rules
    GAM->>DB: + points into points_ledger
    GAM->>GAM: check badge criteria
    alt criteria met
        GAM->>DB: grant user_badge
        GAM->>NOT: notify "You earned a badge!"
        NOT-->>L: Notification + update leaderboard
    end
```

### 12.4. Sequence — ThreatFlip (Turn a Real Attack into a Lesson)

**Description:** The process of "flipping" a real (confirmed) attack email into training content. The Analyst selects a threat email → the ThreatIntel Service asks the AI to **de-identify** it (remove victims' personal information) and generate a simulation template + coaching page → it passes through **moderation** → and is stored as a draft pending approval. This keeps the training content closely aligned with the threats currently in play. Note the privacy compliance at the de-identification step.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor AN as Analyst
    participant REP as Reporting Service
    participant TI as ThreatIntel Service
    participant AIS as AI Service
    participant MOD as Moderation
    participant LRN as Learning/Sim

    AN->>REP: Select confirmed threat email
    REP->>TI: POST convert-to-training
    TI->>AIS: De-identify + generate simulation template/lesson
    AIS->>MOD: Moderate content
    MOD-->>AIS: pass
    AIS-->>TI: Draft template + coaching page
    TI->>LRN: Store sim_template + coaching_page (pending approval)
    LRN-->>AN: Ready to use for campaigns
```

### 12.5. Sequence — Anonymous Culture Survey

**Description:** Measure "security culture" while still protecting identity. The Org Admin creates a survey with the flag `anonymous=true`; when a Learner submits responses, the system **does not store the user_id**. Analytics only aggregates by department, with no way to trace back to an individual. The crucial point when coding: separate the anonymous submission channel from identity at the API layer to ensure no linkage is leaked.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor A as Org Admin
    participant ASM as Assessment Service
    actor L as Learner
    participant ANA as Analytics

    A->>ASM: POST /assessments (type=culture, anonymous=true)
    ASM-->>L: Invite to survey
    L->>ASM: POST responses (WITHOUT user_id)
    ASM->>ANA: Aggregate anonymously by department
    ANA-->>A: Security culture report (no traceback to individual)
```

## 13. WebSocket Specification (Realtime)

The realtime channel for instant alerts & notifications.

- **Endpoint:** `wss://api.digishield.vn/ws?token=<JWT>`
- **Authentication:** JWT in query/handshake; bound to `org_id` to only receive events for the correct tenant.
- **Heartbeat:** ping/pong every 30s; auto-reconnect with backoff.

| Event (server → client) | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `alert.broadcast` | `{ severity, message, source, ts }` | Organization-wide alert |
| `notification.new` | `{ type, payload, ts }` | Personal notification (learning reminder, badge) |
| `campaign.update` | `{ campaign_id, status, stats }` | Campaign progress update (dashboard) |
| `report.status` | `{ report_id, status }` | Report status update for the Analyst |

| Message (client → server) | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `subscribe` | `{ channels: [] }` | Subscribe to channels (alerts, dashboard, etc.) |
| `ack` | `{ event_id }` | Acknowledge receipt of an alert |

## 15. v1.2 Supplement — Proactive Detection & OTT Channels

Adds 3 differentiating features for the Vietnamese context (referencing Hoxhunt/Cofense & the 2026 banking anti-fraud trends): **(1) Real-time scam interception**, **(2) Suspicious recipient account warning**, **(3) Simulation over Zalo/OTT**.

### 15.1. Expanding Simulation Channels (Zalo/OTT)

Expand the `channel` of `sim_templates` / `sim_events`: add `zalo`, `teams`, `slack` alongside `email|sms|qr|usb|voice`. Workers send via the respective APIs (Zalo OA, Microsoft Graph, Slack API). Tracking & coaching reuse the existing mechanism.

### 15.2. Supplementary Data Entities

**Description:** Two tables serving proactive detection. `ACCOUNT_WATCHLIST` stores suspicious recipient accounts/phone numbers/wallets along with a `risk_level` and source (SIMO/NAPAS/A05/user report) — for lookup at the money-transfer point. `INTERVENTION_EVENTS` records each time the system intervenes: the triggering signals (on a call, new payee, large amount, watchlist hit) and the decision (allow/warn/pause/block) for audit and analysis.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ORGANIZATIONS ||--o{ ACCOUNT_WATCHLIST : maintains
    ORGANIZATIONS ||--o{ INTERVENTION_EVENTS : logs
    USERS ||--o{ INTERVENTION_EVENTS : protected

    ACCOUNT_WATCHLIST {
        uuid id PK
        uuid org_id FK
        enum type "bank_account|phone|wallet"
        string value
        enum risk_level "watch|high|confirmed"
        string source "SIMO|NAPAS|A05|user_report"
        timestamp added_at
    }
    INTERVENTION_EVENTS {
        uuid id PK
        uuid org_id FK
        uuid user_id FK
        json signals "on_call|new_payee|high_amount|watchlist_hit"
        enum decision "allow|warn|pause|block"
        string context_ref
        timestamp ts
    }
```

### 15.3. Supplementary Endpoints

| Group | Endpoint | Method | Description |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Interception | `/interventions/evaluate` | POST | Instant risk evaluation at the transaction point (returns allow/warn/pause/block) |
| Interception | `/interventions` | GET | Intervention log (for SOC/reporting) |
| Watchlist | `/account-watchlist` | GET POST | Manage & sync suspicious recipient accounts |
| Watchlist | `/account-watchlist/check` | GET | Quick lookup of an account/phone number at the money-transfer point |

> **Integration:** these endpoints are exposed via an **embedded SDK** (mobile/web) so banking apps, e-wallets, or internal apps can call them at the transfer confirmation step. DigiShield does not execute transactions — it only returns a warning decision.

### 15.4. Sequence — Real-time Scam Interception (active-call detection)

**Description:** The most differentiating feature for the Vietnamese context. At the transfer confirmation step, the app (via the embedded SDK) calls `/interventions/evaluate` with context: the amount, recipient account, *whether the user is currently on a call*, and whether the payee is new. The Intervention Service checks the **watchlist** and combines signals in the **Risk Engine** to reach a decision. If risk is high → it returns `pause` with an educational message ("Is someone instructing you to transfer money over the phone?"), helping the user stay alert against exactly the kind of impersonation scenario (e.g., posing as police). **Important:** DigiShield only *returns a warning decision* — it does not execute or block the transaction; the final decision rests with the banking app and the user. Every intervention is recorded as an `intervention_event`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant APP as Bank App / DigiShield SDK
    participant INT as Intervention Service
    participant WL as Account Watchlist
    participant RISK as Risk Engine

    U->>APP: Confirm transfer (large amount, new recipient)
    APP->>INT: POST /interventions/evaluate<br/>{amount, dest_account, on_call, new_payee}
    INT->>WL: GET check recipient account
    WL-->>INT: risk_level (watchlist hit?)
    INT->>RISK: Combine signals (on call + new payee + amount + watchlist)
    RISK-->>INT: decision
    alt High risk
        INT-->>APP: pause + educational content
        APP-->>U: "Is someone instructing you to transfer money over the phone?"
        U->>APP: User reconsiders / cancels
    else Safe
        INT-->>APP: allow
    end
    INT->>INT: Record intervention_event
```

### 15.5. Traceability Matrix Update

| # | Feature | Main API | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | Zalo/OTT simulation | `/sim/campaigns` (channel=zalo/teams/slack) | Yes |
| 21 | Real-time scam interception | `/interventions/evaluate` | Yes |
| 22 | Suspicious recipient account warning | `/account-watchlist` `/account-watchlist/check` | Yes |

> **Summary:** all 22/22 functional groups are now fully specified (data model + API + diagram).

## 19. Multi-tenant SaaS Architecture

DigiShield serves many organizations (tenants) on the same platform. This chapter specifies how to **isolate, operate, and monetize** under a multi-tenant SaaS model — a decisive factor for scalability, security, and compliance.

### 19.1. Three Data Isolation Models

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph POOL["Pool — shared DB + shared schema"]
        direction LR
        PA[(1 DB · 1 schema)]
        PA --- PR["Separated by tenant_id + Row-Level Security"]
    end
    subgraph BRIDGE["Bridge — shared DB + separate schema"]
        direction LR
        BA[(1 DB)]
        BA --- BS1[schema_tenantA]
        BA --- BS2[schema_tenantB]
    end
    subgraph SILO["Silo — separate infrastructure/DB (or on-premise)"]
        direction LR
        SA[(DB tenant A)]
        SB[(DB tenant B)]
    end
```

| Model | Isolation | Cost/unit | Suitable for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pool** (RLS) | Logical (soft) | Lowest | Schools (very many users, low price) |
| **Bridge** (schema/tenant) | Medium | Medium | General enterprises |
| **Silo** (separate DB/infrastructure, on-prem) | Physical (strong) | High | Government agencies, large enterprises, data sovereignty requirements |

> Recommendation: **one codebase**, configurable across all three "deployment tiers". Default to Pool+RLS for new customers; upgrade to Bridge/Silo based on plan & compliance requirements.

### 19.2. Segment → Deployment Tier Matrix

| Segment | Default Tier | Data residency | Upgrade option |
|---|---|---|---|
| Schools | Pool (domestic cloud) | In-country | Bridge at large scale |
| Enterprises | Bridge (cloud) | In-country | Silo/BYOK for enterprise |
| Government Agencies | Silo / On-premise | Mandatory in-country | Air-gapped as required |

### 19.3. Enforcing Isolation at the Data Layer (RLS)

For the Pool model, do **not** rely solely on the application layer filtering by `tenant_id` — **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security** must be enabled so the DB itself blocks cross-tenant access:

```sql
ALTER TABLE reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON reports
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);
-- Each request sets: SET app.tenant_id = '<from JWT>';
```

- Every business table has a `tenant_id` column (= the current `org_id`), indexed.
- The DB connection uses a *non-superuser* role so that RLS takes effect.
- Mandatory test: an automated test suite verifies that "tenant A cannot read tenant B's data".

### 19.4. Propagating Tenant Context

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant GW as API Gateway
    participant MW as Tenant Middleware
    participant SVC as Service
    participant DB as PostgreSQL (RLS)

    C->>GW: Request + JWT (contains tenant_id)
    GW->>MW: Validate JWT, extract tenant_id
    MW->>MW: Create "tenant context" for the request
    MW->>SVC: Call service with context
    SVC->>DB: SET app.tenant_id = <tenant_id>; query
    DB-->>SVC: Return only the correct tenant's data (RLS)
```

The tenant context must be attached consistently at every storage layer:
- **Cache (Redis):** key prefix `t:{tenant_id}:...`.
- **Queue:** include `tenant_id` in the message; the worker sets the context when processing.
- **Object storage:** bucket/prefix by tenant.
- **Log/metrics/trace:** label with `tenant_id`.

### 19.5. Tenant Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Provisioning: Register / create tenant
    Provisioning --> Configuring: Configure SSO/SCIM, branding
    Configuring --> Seeding: Seed default content (VN scenarios)
    Seeding --> Active: Activate
    Active --> Suspended: Overdue / violation
    Suspended --> Active: Restore
    Active --> Offboarding: Contract ends
    Offboarding --> Exported: Export data for customer
    Exported --> Purged: Delete per Personal Data Protection Decree
    Purged --> [*]
```

- **Offboarding** must support *exporting all data* and *permanent deletion* in accordance with the Personal Data Protection regulations.

### 19.6. Per-tenant Customization

| Item | How |
|---|---|
| Branding | Logo, colors, subdomain (`tenantA.digishield.vn`) |
| Content | Own lesson/template library + inherit the shared library |
| Policy | Risk thresholds, mandatory training, default language |
| Features | **Feature flags** by plan (enable/disable deepfake sim, ThreatFlip, intervention SDK, etc.) |

### 19.7. Resource Isolation & Anti "Noisy Neighbor"

- **Per-tenant rate-limit & quota** at the API Gateway (number of requests, number of campaigns, emails/month).
- **Queue partitioning** or fair weighting so that one tenant's bulk sending does not congest another tenant.
- **Metering** of every consumed resource (emails/SMS sent, AI calls, storage) for billing & over-limit alerting.

### 19.8. Security & Data Sovereignty

- **Data residency:** in-country storage; Silo/on-prem for government agencies.
- **BYOK (bring-your-own encryption key):** enterprise/gov manage their own keys; per-tenant encryption.
- **Per-tenant audit:** `audit_logs` filtered by `tenant_id`; tenant admins see only their own logs; Super Admin sees cross-tenant in a controlled manner.
- **Secret isolation:** secrets/SSO config separated per tenant in the secrets manager.

### 19.9. Billing & Metering

- Plans by segment: per-seat (enterprise), per-project/unit (government), per-student (schools).
- Tie **subscription + plan + feature flags**; metering (section 19.7) is the source for invoices & plan limits.

### 19.10. Supplementary Data Model for Multi-tenant

```

> Note: `tenant_id` replaces/is unified with `org_id` in the business tables in Sections 5 & 12. One `tenant` can map to one or more `organizations` (e.g., a corporation with multiple units).
