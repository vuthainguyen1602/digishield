## Document Index

### 1. Technical Design (for development)
- **DigiShield_Technical_Design.md** — Design document (19 chapters, ~29 Mermaid diagrams): architecture, ER, sequence, state, flowchart, use case, BPMN, DFD, and **Chapter 19 — Multi-tenant SaaS Architecture** (§19.1–19.10 design: Pool/Bridge/Silo isolation models, Row-Level Security, tenant lifecycle, billing; **§19.11 Implementation Guide**: RLS, tenant context, provisioning, per-tier deployment, multi-tenant CI/CD migration, BYOK, isolation testing, and provision/suspend/offboard runbooks). Includes a description of each diagram.
- **DigiShield_openapi.yaml** — OpenAPI 3.0.3 API specification (**56 paths · 74 operations · 30 schemas**, including Auth/MFA, business operations, and Tenancy/Billing) — import into Swagger/Postman or generate an SDK (the frontend generates its typed client from this file via orval).
- **DigiShield_bpmn_incident_response.bpmn** — Report handling & alert dispatch process.
- **DigiShield_bpmn_content_approval.bpmn** — AI content approval process.
- **DigiShield_bpmn_sim_campaign.bpmn** — Simulation campaign process.
  > Open the .bpmn files with demo.bpmn.io or Camunda Modeler.
- **DigiShield_ADR.md** — Architecture decision log + **Realization Appendix**. **ADR-001:** Modular Monolith oriented toward gradual extraction (instead of full microservices/serverless). **ADR-002:** backend **Java + Spring Boot + Spring Modulith** (realized on Java 25 / Spring Boot 4.1.0) — rationale, trade-offs, alternatives. **ADR-003:** choosing **Flyway** (not Liquibase) for database migration. **ADR-004:** monorepo-lite React/TypeScript frontend with an OpenAPI-generated client. The **Realization Appendix** (formerly the separate Architecture/Deploy/CICD doc) covers the Gradle multi-module + Spring Modulith directory architecture, tenant context in Spring, container packaging (1 image · api/worker/scheduler profiles), Helm (cloud & on-prem/air-gapped), and CI/CD.

### 2. Interface Design
- **DigiShield_UIUX_Spec.md** — UI/UX specification: design system, app shell, complete wireframes for 6 roles (Admin, Manager, Analyst, Content Editor, Super Admin, Learner) plus auth, mobile, intervention SDK, and error states.

### 3. Code (sibling directories in this monorepo)
- **digishield/** — Backend: Gradle multi-module + Spring Modulith app (Java **25**, Spring Boot **4.1.0**, Spring Modulith **2.1.0**, Gradle **9.6.1** wrapper) realizing ADR-001 & ADR-002: 16 subprojects (boot/app, contracts, 5 shared, 9 business modules), convention plugins in buildSrc, tenant-context + RLS aspect, inter-module events (Modulith events), Dockerfile/Helm/CI, JaCoCo, Checkstyle, UT (`*Test`) + IT (`*IT`, Testcontainers), Flyway migrations under `db/migration`. See `digishield/README.md`. Build: `./gradlew build` (wrapper committed — no separate install). A `dev` H2 profile and a prod-like Postgres+Flyway compose are documented in its README / `RUN_PRODLIKE.md`.
  > **Note:** ADR-002 originally pinned Java 21 LTS, then took the forward-compatible upgrade path it described (Java 25 + Boot 4.x + Gradle ≥ 9.1). The ADR records that history; **Java 25 is the current state** of both the code and the docs.
- **frontend/** — Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript (strict) + Vite 5 app per ADR-004: design tokens from the UI/UX spec, App Shell with role-based navigation, RBAC routing for 6 roles, shared UI components, ~29 feature pages (auth, dashboard, campaigns, learning, soc, super, …), and a typed API client generated from `DigiShield_openapi.yaml` (orval / TanStack Query). Self-contained **npm** toolchain — NOT a Gradle subproject. Run: `npm install && npm run dev`. See `frontend/README.md`.

> CI/CD lives at the **monorepo root** `.github/workflows/` (`backend-ci.yml`, `frontend-ci.yml`) with path filters; the backend workflow pushes its image to GHCR on `main`.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Keep `DigiShield_openapi.yaml` as the contract source of truth; regenerate the frontend client (`npm run gen:api`) when it changes.
- Build an HTML/Figma prototype from `DigiShield_UIUX_Spec.md` (see also `design_handoff_digishield/`).
